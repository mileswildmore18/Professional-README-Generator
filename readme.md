 ## Description
  
This project will demonstrate how to create a README file from scratch with a README generator that will make creating a README file a lot easier from the command line instead of typing it all out. Also found out how to gather up information about the badges we use and what they are all about when you choose them for more information.  Also learned how to install the README files with the node protocol manager and what inquirer is needed for the project itself. This project gave me a chance to also understand how the Node.js software actually builds a README file from nothing and turn it into a professional file. It also taught me how to test to see if the README generator is functioning properly so that it can be used for future reference. You will be able to add in all the information provided to you when prompted as demonstrated in the video link below.
